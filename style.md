Snowdrift.coop design guidelines
================================

Here we are collecting some simple notes for CSS and related design for the site.

Although we use Twitter Bootstrap, we are favoring our own simple CSS in many cases. Our CSS is specified in /templates/default-layout.cassius

Although px units are used for things like border thickness, we mostly stick to em units for anything relating to fonts and other text elements like line height.

If any element is not specified in default-layout.cassius, it is likely that nobody has considered it specifically for our site. In such cases, some sort of default will be generated. Do not assume that we have any preference for that default.

Our overall goal is a simple yet attractive, easy to read site.
